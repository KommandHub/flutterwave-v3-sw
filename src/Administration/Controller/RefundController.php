/**
 * Admin refund endpoint for Flutterwave.
 *
 * Deliberately kept to HTTP concerns only — reading the request, calling
 * collaborator services in order, and translating their results/exceptions
 * into a {@see JsonResponse}. All refund business logic lives in dedicated
 * services this controller composes:
 *
 *  - {@see RefundEligibilityResolver} decides whether the transaction may be
 *    refunded at all (feature flag, transaction state, Flutterwave
 *    transaction id, order currency) and resolves the static facts
 *    (`RefundContext`) the rest of the flow needs.
 *  - {@see FlutterwaveRefundLedgerInterface} reads Flutterwave's own refund
 *    records for a transaction — the authoritative source for "how much has
 *    already been refunded", since a refund can be raised outside this shop.
 *  - {@see RefundAmountCalculator} validates the requested (or implied "full
 *    remaining balance") amount against that ledger and resolves the exact
 *    amount to send to Flutterwave.
 *  - {@see OrderTransactionService} owns the local Shopware side: creating
 *    the pending capture/refund entities and, later (via the
 *    `refund.completed` webhook), completing them.
 *
 * ## The refund workflow, end to end
 *
 * 1. **Initiation** — an admin submits an amount (or none, for "refund
 *    everything remaining") against a Shopware order transaction. This
 *    controller resolves eligibility, computes and validates the amount, and
 *    calls `POST /transactions/{id}/refund` on Flutterwave.
 * 2. **Acknowledgement, not completion** — Flutterwave refunds are
 *    asynchronous ("usually 3-15 working days"), so a `success` response
 *    here only means the refund was *accepted*, not that money has moved.
 * 3. **Local pending record** — {@see OrderTransactionService::createRefund()}
 *    creates (or, on a retry, re-finds) an `order_transaction_capture` and
 *    an `order_transaction_capture_refund` entity, both in their initial
 *    (pending) state.
 * 4. **Deterministic UUIDs** — both entity ids are derived from Flutterwave's
 *    own identifiers via `Uuid::fromStringToHex()` rather than generated
 *    randomly: the capture id from the Flutterwave transaction id (so every
 *    refund against the same transaction resolves to the same capture,
 *    closing a race where two concurrent requests could otherwise create two
 *    captures), and the refund id from the Flutterwave refund id (so a
 *    retried request is an idempotent no-op instead of a duplicate entity).
 *    See {@see OrderTransactionService::createRefund()} for the full
 *    rationale.
 * 5. **Pending state handling** — the refund stays pending in Shopware until
 *    Flutterwave confirms the outcome. The admin transaction detail reads the
 *    local capture/refund records straight from the Shopware repositories to
 *    show that progress, so this controller only needs to *create* the refund,
 *    not serve it back for display.
 * 6. **Webhook correlation and completion** — the Flutterwave refund id is
 *    stored on the local refund's `externalReference`. When Flutterwave's
 *    `refund.completed` webhook arrives,
 *    `Webhook\Subscriber\RefundCompletedSubscriber` finds the matching
 *    pending refund by that value and transitions it to completed or failed,
 *    never trusting the webhook payload beyond the id used to find the
 *    record (see that subscriber's docblock for why).
 * 7. **Error handling and recovery** — once Flutterwave has accepted the
 *    refund, money is already moving; a failure creating the local record
 *    (step 3) is logged loudly but still reports success to the admin,
 *    because failing the HTTP request at that point would tell the merchant
 *    the refund did not happen when it did. The record can be reconciled
 *    later from Flutterwave's own refund history, which this controller
 *    already treats as authoritative. Failures *before* the Flutterwave call
 *    (eligibility, amount validation, the refund-list lookup used to compute
 *    the balance) are all safe to reject outright, since no money has moved.
