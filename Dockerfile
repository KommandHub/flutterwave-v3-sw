# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# shopware-cli, for validating this plugin from inside its own test container.
#
# It is published as a purpose-built image containing nothing but the static Go
# binary (~50 MB, multi-arch: amd64 and arm64). Copying the binary out of it is
# the leanest install available: no apt source to add, no curl/gpg tooling to
# install, no archive to clean up, and a single layer. The alternative — the
# full shopware/shopware-cli:<version> image — is ~1.25 GB to pull for one file.
#
# ":bin" tracks the latest stable release, which is what this environment wants:
# validation should reflect what the Shopware Store runs today. The trade-off is
# that a rebuild can pick up a newer CLI. Pin it for a reproducible build by
# passing a digest:
#
#   docker compose build \
#     --build-arg SHOPWARE_CLI_IMAGE=shopware/shopware-cli:bin@sha256:<digest>
ARG SHOPWARE_CLI_IMAGE=shopware/shopware-cli:bin

# dockware already ships PHP with pcov built in, and phpunit.dist.xml configures
# it (pcov.directory=src, relative — portable across containers) via its own
# <ini> block. A second, image-level pcov config would be redundant and, worse,
# drift from the phpunit.dist.xml source of truth; none is added here.

# Restore the image's declared default user, or the container would run as root.
#
# It must be "dockware" specifically, not "www-data". They share uid 33, so the
# two look interchangeable — but dockware's entrypoint escalates with sudo, and
# the sudo rights are granted to the dockware account. Setting USER www-data
# starts the container as the same uid under a name sudo has no rule for, and
# boot dies with "sudo: a password is required".
USER dockware
