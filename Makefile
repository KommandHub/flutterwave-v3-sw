# This plugin may ship at any stability (see "version" in composer.json), while
# the Shopware install it is tested against pins minimum-stability to "stable".
# Composer therefore refuses to resolve a pre-release unless the requirement
# carries its own stability flag:
#
#   Could not find a version of package kommandhub/flutterwave-v3-sw matching your
#   minimum-stability (stable).
#
# Composer's ladder is: dev < alpha < beta < RC < stable. A flag accepts its own
# level *and everything above it*, so "@dev" — the bottom rung — accepts every
# stability there is. That makes this work unchanged for 0.9.0-alpha.1,
# -beta.1, -RC1, a dev- branch, and 1.0.0 stable, with no edit per release.
# ("@beta" would have covered beta/RC/stable but silently broken on an alpha.)
#
# This is a PER-PACKAGE flag: the root minimum-stability stays "stable", so no
# other dependency can quietly resolve to a pre-release. That containment is why
# this is preferred over relaxing minimum-stability globally.
#
# It is only permissive about *stability*, not about which package is chosen:
# this plugin resolves from the custom/static-plugins path repository, which
# offers exactly one candidate — the working tree being tested.
